      <h3>Newborn Photos</h3>
      <p>
        This session has no time limit as I work around the baby’s schedule. Typically this takes place in your home where the baby is most comfortable. I take a “lifestyle” approach to these sessions and try to capture those everyday moments at home with your baby. I also come prepared to get a few posed, traditional photos as well. Newborn photos are typically taken within the first two weeks of birth. You will receive 40-50 edited digital images as well as a printing release.
