<p class="editable"> Hi, I'm Erin Wright, a Walla Walla based photographer that specializes in natural light family photography. I first became interested in photography when my oldest daughter was born and I was desperate to capture all those precious fleeting moments. I bought my first "nice camera" and set out to master a new hobby. I took several photography courses and just kept practicing! A couple of cameras and four kids later and people began asking me to capture their family as well! Soon my business was born! I absolutely love being able to provide families with images of their lives! Whether it's your big wedding day or a normal Saturday at the park with your kiddos, I would love to help you capture this season of your life!</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="editable">Erin did such an awesome job on Joshua's senior pictures. For a kid that doesn't love having his picture taken she did a great job of putting him at ease and making his photo shoot so much fun. Thanks Erin we so appreciate all of your hard work! I highly recommend having Erin do your pictures. We will use her again for our daughters pictures! -Teresa Pettyjohn
